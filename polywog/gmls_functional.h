// form for a solution u and or its derivatives, projected to a polynomial 
// vector space. The approximation of the functional by linear combinations 
// of solution data on nodes is an extension of the Moving Least Squares (MLS) 
// approximation that is referred to as Generalized Moving Least Squares 
// (see Mirzaei et al, "On generalized moving least squares and diffuse 
// derivatives", IMA J. Numer. Anal. 32, 983 (2012)).

// This construct is useful in constructing Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin 
// (MLPG) methods that do not rely on shape functions, such as the Direct 
// MLPG (DMLPG) method.
