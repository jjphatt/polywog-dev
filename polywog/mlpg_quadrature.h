// This file contains several quadrature rules for evaluating volume and 
// surface integrals using the Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin method, which 
// does not rely on a background mesh.

// This quadrature rule computes surface integrals over cubes whose extents 
// are defined by the ratio of its side to the extent associated with a 
// subdomain. The rule is associated with the given point cloud and (scalar) 
// subdomain extents field, and has the given number of points on a side.
